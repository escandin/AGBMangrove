abstract = {Mangroves have a global distribution within coastal tropical and subtropical climates, and have even expanded to some temperate locales. Where theydooccur,mangroves provide a plethora ofgoods andservices, rangingfromcoastal protectionfromstorms anderosion todirect incomeforhuman societies.Themangrove literature hasbecomerathervoluminous, promptingmanysubdisciplineswithinafield that earlier in the20th century received little focus. Much of this research has become diffuse by sheer numbers, requiring detailed syntheses to make research results widely available to resourcemanagers. In this review,wetakeaninclusive approachin focusingoneco-physiologicalandgrowthconstraints tothe establishment andearly developmentofmangrove seedlings in the intertidalzone.This is a critical life stageformangroves, i.e., the period betweendispersalandrecruitment to the saplingstage.Webeginwith someof the researchthat has set the precedent for seedling-level eco-physiological research inmangroves, andthenwe focus on recent advances (circa. 1995 to present) in our understanding of temperature, carbon dioxide, salinity, light, nutrient, flooding, and specific biotic influences on seedling survival and growth.Assuch,wetake a newapproach in describing seedling response to global factors (e.g., temperature) alongwithsite-specific factors (e.g., salinity).All variableswill strongly influence the future of seedlingdynamics inways perhaps not yetdocumented in mature forests. Furthermore, understanding how different mangrove species can respond to global factors and regional influences is useful for diagnosingobservedmortality withinmangrovewetlands,managed or natural.This reviewprovides an updated eco-physiologicalknowledge base for future research and reforestation activity, and for understanding important links among climate change, local physico-chemical condition, and establishment and early growth of mangrove seedlings.},
