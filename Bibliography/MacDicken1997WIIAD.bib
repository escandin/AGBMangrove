abstract = {This guide describes a system of cost-effective methods for monitoring, measuring, and verifying carbon storage on on a commercial basis, for three types of land use: forest plantations, managed natural forests, and agroforestry systems. The methods were developed by the Forest Carbon Monitoring Program of Winrock International as a way to provide reliable results using accepted principles and practices of forest inventory, soil science and ecological surveys. The system assesses changes in four main carbon pools: above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, soils, and standing litter crops. It aims to assess the net change in each pool for project and non-project (or pre-project) areas over a specified time period. Although carbon monitoring requires specialized equipment and trained personnel, the system aims to minimize the associated costs. The components of the system are: (1) baseline determination of pre-project carbon pools in biomass, soils and standing litter crop; (2) establishment of permanent sample plots for periodic measurement of changes in carbon pools; (3) plotless vegetation survey methods (quarter point and quadrant sampling) to measure carbon stored in non-project areas or areas with sparse vegetation; (4) calculation of the net difference in carbon accumulated in project and non-project land uses; (5) use of satellite images and base maps to gauge vegetation changes; (6) computer software to calculate minimum sample size; (7) computer modelling of changes in carbon storage for periods between field measurements; and (8) a database of biomass partitioning (roots, wood, foliage) for selected species. There is a companion guide, entitled Field Tests of Carbon Monitoring Methods in Forestry Projects.},
